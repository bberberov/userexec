# userexec

A collection of scripts and tools.  They are either wrappers, too small for an independent package, to too early in their development.

## Usage

These scripts and tools assume that the `which` command is always available!  The availability of other commands it tested with it.  Simple scripts which use `sed` will generate normal "not found" errors.

## Goals

- Cross-platform: Windows, Linux, macOS, BSD, ...
